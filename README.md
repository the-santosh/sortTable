# Local Set up

1. Clone repository on your local system
2. To serve this app locally you can user any server. For static file serving I recommend "http-server", install this package globally by running "npm install -g http-server" on command prompt
3. In command prompt go to "sortTable" folder and run "http-server" cmd and open app in "localhost:8080"
4. Click on any column to sort data in asc/desc order
5. To run unit test cases, open specRunner.html file in browser
